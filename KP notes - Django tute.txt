Working through this Django tutorial playlist (10 hrs) by Corey Schafer: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p



For this tute, I created a virtual environment in the Environments dir called project1_env (AS OF 23-JUN TRYING THIS AGAIN ON NEW PC, USED PROJECT2)
I've already installed Django into this virtual env
When I want to work on the project, open cmd prompt, navigate to that dir, go into scripts dir and type 'activate'
when finished, type 'deactivate'
to run the server, 'python manage.py runserver'

Files for the project are not stored within the environment, which should only be used for packages/libraries.
Files live in the django_project dir within github local repos. Open this project in PyCharm using the virtual env (should be in the project config already)

To view the site, open Chrome and go to 'http://localhost:8000', bookmarked as 'Django local server'

Notes
in Django ORM, represent db structure as classes - these classes are called models
each class is going to be its own table in the db
each attribute within the class will be a different field in the db

To load django shell, command is 'python manage.py shell'
